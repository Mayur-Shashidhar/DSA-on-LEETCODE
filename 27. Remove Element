QUESTION:
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
  Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
  Return k.



APPROACH:
Two Pointers (Swap to End)
Since we don’t care about the order of the remaining elements, the most optimal approach is:
1.Use two pointers:
    i → current index scanning through the array.
    n → current “effective array size” (initially numsSize).
2.While i < n:
    If nums[i] == val:
      Swap nums[i] with nums[n-1]
      Decrease n (ignore last position)
    Else → i++ (move to next element)
3.At the end, n is the count of elements not equal to val.
4.The first n elements of nums are the result.



CODE:
int removeElement(int* nums, int numsSize, int val) {
    int i = 0;
    int n = numsSize;

    while (i < n) {
        if (nums[i] == val) {
            nums[i] = nums[n - 1]; 
            n--; 
        } else {
            i++; 
        }
    }
    return n;
}
