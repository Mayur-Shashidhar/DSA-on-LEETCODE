QUESTION :
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

APPROACH:
1.Use two nested loops.
2.For each element, check if there exists another element that sums up to the target.
3.Return the pair of indices when found.

CODE:
#include <stdlib.h>
int* twoSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int target, int* returnSize) {
    *returnSize = 2;
    int* result = malloc(2 * sizeof(int));

    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numsSize; j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                result[0] = i;
                result[1] = j;
                return result;
            }
        }
    }
    return NULL;
}
