QUESTION:
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.


APPROACH:
1.Negative numbers are never palindromes (they have a - sign in front).
2.Numbers ending in 0 are not palindromes unless they are 0 itself (e.g., 10 → false).
3.To avoid extra space, we can reverse half of the number and compare with the other half — this prevents overflow and avoids converting to a string.



CODE:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

bool isPalindrome(int x) {
    
    if (x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0))
        return false;

    int reversedHalf = 0;
    while (x > reversedHalf) {
        reversedHalf = reversedHalf * 10 + x % 10;
        x /= 10;
    }

    
    return (x == reversedHalf) || (x == reversedHalf / 10);
}
