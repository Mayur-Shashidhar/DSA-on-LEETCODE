OUESTION:
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

APPROACH:
1.Initialize a dummy head node to simplify list building.
2.Keep two pointers: one for each linked list (l1, l2).
3.Maintain a carry variable for sums greater than 9.
4.In each step:
    1.Get the value from l1 and l2 (or 0 if one list is shorter).
    2.Sum them with the carry.
    3.Create a new node with sum % 10.
    4.Update carry to sum / 10.
5.After processing both lists, if there's a remaining carry, add a new node for it.


CODE:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list is already provided:
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct ListNode *next;
 * };
 */

struct ListNode* addTwoNumbers(struct ListNode* l1, struct ListNode* l2) {
    struct ListNode dummy;
    dummy.next = NULL;
    struct ListNode *tail = &dummy;
    int carry = 0;

    while (l1 != NULL || l2 != NULL || carry > 0) {
        int sum = carry;
        if (l1 != NULL) {
            sum += l1->val;
            l1 = l1->next;
        }
        if (l2 != NULL) {
            sum += l2->val;
            l2 = l2->next;
        }
        carry = sum / 10;

        struct ListNode* newNode = malloc(sizeof(struct ListNode));
        newNode->val = sum % 10;
        newNode->next = NULL;

        tail->next = newNode;
        tail = newNode;
    }

    return dummy.next;
}
