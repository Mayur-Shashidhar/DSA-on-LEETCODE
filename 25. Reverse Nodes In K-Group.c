/*
QUESTION:
Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.



APPROACH:
Iterative with Group Reversal
We can solve this in O(n) time using pointer manipulation:
Steps:
1.Count nodes in list to know how many complete groups of k exist.
2.Use a dummy node pointing to head for easier head management after reversal.
3.Keep a pointer prevGroup which points to the node before the current group to reverse.
4.For each complete group:
  Let groupStart = prevGroup->next
  Let groupEnd = prevGroup->next advanced k times
  Reverse the nodes in that group in-place
  Connect:
  prevGroup->next -> new head of reversed group
  end of reversed group -> next group's start
  Move prevGroup to the end of the reversed group.
5.Stop when fewer than k nodes remain.
